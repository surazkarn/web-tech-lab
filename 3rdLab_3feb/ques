Lab 3

Exp 1. Program to print your name, roll no, section and branch in separate lines.


Exp 2. Write a program in Java to take first name and last name from user and print both in one line
as last name followed by first name.


Exp 3. Make program to makes a multiplication table as shown below.
1 2 3 4 5
2 4 6 8 10
3 6 9 12 15
4 8 12 16 20
Hints for Solution – It is simple output formatting problem. Say the third line from top may be
written as.
System.out.println(1*3 +“\t”+2*3+“\t”+3*3+“\t”+3*4 +“\t”+3*5);
Similarly other lines may be written.

Exp 4.- Write a program to generate a of random numbers between 1 and 6.
Hints for Solution - The random numbers may be generated by using method random of class
Math. The code may be written as:
randarray = (int)(10*Math.random()%6) +1;
