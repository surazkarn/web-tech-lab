1. Find the largest among 3 user entered nos. at the command prompt using Java.
2. Accept 10 numbers from command line and check how many of them are even and how
many odd.
3. Write a program to calculate area according to user input, whether it is circle, square or
triangle (Menu Driven).
4. Write a class file â€“ box with three data members (length, width, height) and a method
volume() . Also implement the application class Demo where an object of the box class is
created with user entered dimensions and volume is printed.
Hints: class Box
{
// create volume ()
{
}
}
classDemo
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
//create object of class Box
//Take three input through key board
//call volume method
// Print the volume
// Print the three input parameters
}
}
5. Write a program which will overload the area () method and display the area of a circle,
triangle and square as per user choice and user entered dimensions.

Hints:
class OverloadDemo
{
void area(float x) { }
void area(float x, float y) { }
void area(double x) { }
}
class Overload
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
//create object
ob.area(value);
ob.area(value, value);
ob.area(value);
}
}
