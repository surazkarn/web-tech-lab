Lab 6: Experiments List

1. Write a program in java to input and display the details of n number of students having
roll, name and cgpa as data members. Also display the name of the student having lowest
cgpa.
2. Illustrate the execution of constructors in multi-level inheritance with three Java classes –
plate(int length, int width), box(length, width, height), wood box (length, width, height,
thick).
Hints:
Class plate{
Int length, width;
Plate(int a, int b){
Length= a;
Width=b;
}
}
Class box extends plate{
Int length, width, hight;
box(int a, int b, int c){
super(a,b);
hight=c;
}
}
3. Write a program in java to define a class Shape which has data member „area‟ and a
member function showArea(). Derive two classes Circle and Rectangle from Shape class. Add
appropriate data members and member functions to calculate and display the area of Circle
and Rectangle.
4. Write a program to create an Account class containing acc_no, balance as data members
and disp() to display the details. Inherit it in Person class with all mentioned data members
and functions. Person class also has name and aadhar_no as extra data members of its own.
Override disp() function. Create 3 persons‟ details.
5. Write a program in java using inheritance to show how to call the base class
parameterized constructors from the derived class using super.
